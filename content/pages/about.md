Hi! I'm David. Let me tell you a bit about myself.

![I am a studious man. With Studious plans.](/media/image-2.jpg)

I like to think in terms of systems. This has given me a leg up as a
programmer and as a designer. I solve problems, and I try to solve
them in a methodical way.

These days I live in a world of Javascript. I started my programming
adventure in C, modern javascript makes me feel like a wizard in
comparison. These days you can usually find me building sites with the
great [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org).
